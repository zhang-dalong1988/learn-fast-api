# Static Files

You can serve static files automatically from a directory using `StaticFiles`.

## Use `StaticFiles`

- Import `StaticFiles`.
- "Mount" a `StaticFiles()` instance in a specific path.

Python 3.8+

```
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles

app = FastAPI()

app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="static"), name="static")
```

Technical Details

You could also use `from starlette.staticfiles import StaticFiles`.

__FastAPI__ provides the same `starlette.staticfiles` as `fastapi.staticfiles` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But it actually comes directly from Starlette.

### What is "Mounting"

"Mounting" means adding a complete "independent" application in a specific path, that then takes care of handling all the sub-paths.

This is different from using an `APIRouter` as a mounted application is completely independent. The OpenAPI and docs from your main application won't include anything from the mounted application, etc.

You can read more about this in the Advanced User Guide.

## Details

The first `"/static"` refers to the sub-path this "sub-application" will be "mounted" on. So, any path that starts with `"/static"` will be handled by it.

The `directory="static"` refers to the name of the directory that contains your static files.

The `name="static"` gives it a name that can be used internally by __FastAPI__.

All these parameters can be different than "`static`", adjust them with the needs and specific details of your own application.

## More info

For more details and options check Starlette's docs about Static Files.
