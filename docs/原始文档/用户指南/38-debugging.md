# Debugging

You can connect the debugger in your editor, for example with Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.

## Call `uvicorn`

In your FastAPI application, import and run `uvicorn` directly:

Python 3.8+

```
import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def root():
    a = "a"
    b = "b" + a
    return {"hello world": b}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

### About `__name__ == "__main__"`

The main purpose of the `__name__ == "__main__"` is to have some code that is executed when your file is called with:

```
$ python myapp.py
```

but is not called when another file imports it, like in:

```
from myapp import app
```

#### More details

Let's say your file is named `myapp.py`.

If you run it with:

```
$ python myapp.py
```

then the internal variable `__name__` in your file, created automatically by Python, will have as value the string `"__main__"`.

So, the section:

```
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

will run.

---

This won't happen if you import that module (file).

So, if you have another file `importer.py` with:

```
from myapp import app

# Some more code
```

in that case, the automatically created variable `__name__` inside of `myapp.py` will not have the value `"__main__"`.

So, the line:

```
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

will not be executed.

Info

For more information, check the official Python docs.

## Run your code with your debugger

Because you are running the Uvicorn server directly from your code, you can call your Python program (your FastAPI application) directly from the debugger.

---

For example, in Visual Studio Code, you can:

- Go to the "Debug" panel.
- "Add configuration...".
- Select "Python"
- Run the debugger with the option "`Python: Current File (Integrated Terminal)`".

It will then start the server with your __FastAPI__ code, stop at your breakpoints, etc.

Here's how it might look:

If you use Pycharm, you can:

- Open the "Run" menu.
- Select the option "Debug...".
- Then a context menu shows up.
- Select the file to debug (in this case, `main.py`).

It will then start the server with your __FastAPI__ code, stop at your breakpoints, etc.
